EEC 173A - Computer Networks Project 2

In Part 1, we implemented a DNS client to resolve the IP address for tmz.com from scratch using socket API. We were not allowed to use any libraries/methods that simplify DNS implementation such as gethostbyname, getaddrinfo, etc. 

In Part 2, we automatically visited 1,000 different websites and analyzed the HTTP traffic while visiting each site.
